            <h4 class="question">What do you charge to collect Fees or Payments Due?</h4>
            <div class="answer">
                Lets say a School adds a $6.00 fee to a CloudeNote. When a Parent or Caregiver pays - then they will pay $6.00 + 30c for processing. When we
                send the funds to the School, we deduct 4.5% + 12c for processing. So the School will receive $6.00 - $0.39 = $5.61. Need to know more? Click
